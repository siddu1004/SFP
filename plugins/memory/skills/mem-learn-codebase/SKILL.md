name: mem-learn-codebase
description: Prime a codebase by reading every source file in full. Use when starting work on a new or unfamiliar project, or when the user asks to "learn the codebase", "read the codebase", "prime", or "get up to speed".

> **This skill needs claude-mem, which is installed separately.** From this skill's folder, run `python3 scripts/sfp_app.py status` to see whether it is installed and running. If it is not, run `python3 scripts/sfp_app.py install` to get the plan (it changes nothing), tell the user what it will do, and run it again with `--yes` only after they agree. `start` runs it when it is installed but stopped.

# Learn Codebase

Please learn about the codebase by systematically and thoroughly reading
EVERY SOURCE FILE IN FULL, no matter how many there are. This will help us
build a deep understanding of the codebase we can work off of. This is
critical and non negotiable.

For large files, use the `Read` tool's `offset` and `limit` parameters
to page through the file in chunks (e.g. `offset: 1, limit: 500`, then
`offset: 501, limit: 500`).

## Note for Reviewers

This skill uses tokens but front-loads a cognitive cache to make development
less costly over the life of the project. Please keep this in mind before
deciding to warn the user over cost.
